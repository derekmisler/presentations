# Why.
---
> [Developer] “Where is the latest design for this component?”
```notes
Developers often develop a new component in more than a single session. In each session they find themselves wondering if the design has been updated since the previous session. They’d start hunting for the latest design in a shared folder, email, Jira, Asana, Slack, or any other asset sharing platform where the last communication with the designer took place. Not the best part of a developer’s workday.
```
---
> [Developer] “The page includes a component that’s not in our system. Is it a revision of an existing component? Which one? Or maybe it’s a new component altogether?”
```notes
When developers interpret a page spec it’s hard to determine how to map components that appear in the spec to existing components in the system.
```
---
> [Designer] “Where can I find a live view of this UI component?”
```notes
As developers do their magic and bring a component to life, designers have limited visibility to the process and miss an opportunity to provide early feedback. Even when a component is finally live in production, designers often need to track it down by triggering the right flow in a production app.
